---

## Architecture

The app is built using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern for simplicity and ease of maintenance. Key responsibilities are separated as follows:

- **Model**: Handles data and API responses (e.g., `Recipe`, `Ingredient`).
- **View**: Manages UI components and custom views (e.g., `RecipeCell` for displaying recipe cards).
- **Controller**: Controls view behavior, handles user interactions, and communicates with models.

---

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

- **Assets**: Images, icons, and colors.
- **Models**: Data models for recipes, ingredients, and store items.
- **Controllers**: View controllers for each screen, such as `HomeViewController` and `RecipeDetailViewController`.
- **Views**: Custom UI components, such as `RecipeCell` for list items.
- **Network**: Contains network requests and API handling (e.g., `NetworkManager`).
- **Utils**: Helper functions, extensions, and reusable code.
